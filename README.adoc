= othello -- OpenGL Othello game
:toc: left
:source-highlighter: coderay

Othello is a board game for two players.

Objective of the game is to conquer the board with your color. Players
place disks on the board in turn such that they trap at least one of
the opponents' disks between their own disks. Those trapped disks are
turned upside down so that they change color. If the player can't
place a disk on the board, shift is transfered to the opponent. If
neither player can play, game is over.  Player with more disks is the
winner.
